* Here's a one-file generator of the paper sheet for maths practices.
* Yes all the kids would hate me.
* I embed a jQuery in it, because of lazy.
* I also embed a svg file for being the logo, anyone can remove it if needed.
* It will be better if always keep it to a single-file html, for the parents who'd like to save it to local and use without the net...
* Yes I know the code sucks, I'm NOT a professional developer, help me to correct it if you find any bug.
